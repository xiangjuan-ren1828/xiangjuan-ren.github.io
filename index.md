Hello — I'm Xiangjun. 

- 🔭 My research investigates the computational and neural mechanisms underlying human learning, memory, and decision making, with particular focus on how the brain integrates environmental information and transforms it into accessible memory representations that support adaptive behavior. I also examine how these cognitive processes change across the lifespan through age-comparative studies. My work employs a multidisciplinary approach combining behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and neuroimaging techniques.
