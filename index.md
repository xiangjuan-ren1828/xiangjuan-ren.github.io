Hellooo!

- I am a postdoct at Universität Hamburg and Max Planck Institute for Human Development, working with Prof. Nicolas Schuck. Before moving to Germany, I completed my PhD in psychology at Peking University and subsequently held a postdoctoral position there, working with Prof. Hang Zhang and Prof. Huan Luo. I received my undergraduate training in Biotechnology at Shandong University. 
- My research investigates the computational and neural mechanisms underlying human learning, memory, and decision making, with particular focus on how the brain integrates environmental information and transforms it into accessible memory representations that support adaptive behavior. I also examine how these cognitive processes change across the lifespan through age-comparative studies. My work employs a multidisciplinary approach combining behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and neuroimaging techniques.
<!-- - Outside of work, I enjoy pencil sketching, going to the theatre, taking long strolls, and moments of quiet mind-wandering. -->
